Identify the most important in-game behaviours that indicate the player’s length of being self-isolated/social distancing- Rahul/Naveen 

Develop a machine learning model that can be used to predict a player’s length of being self-isolated/ social distancing based on in-game behaviour variables only. To do this, you will need to split the dataset into training, test, and evaluation sets. Evaluate your model’s performance using appropriate metrics. Please describe the method you used for your model, and your motivation for choosing the specific methods. – Rahul/Naveen
